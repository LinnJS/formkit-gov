# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool
that works with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your
code. You can find the full documentation for it
[in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## Creating a Changeset

To create a new changeset, run:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

Follow the prompts to:

1. Select which packages have been changed
2. Choose the semver bump type (patch, minor, major)
3. Write a summary of the changes

## Versioning Packages

When you're ready to release, run:

```bash
pnpm version-packages
```

This will consume all changesets and update package versions accordingly.

## Publishing

Publishing happens automatically via the release workflow when changes are pushed to main.
